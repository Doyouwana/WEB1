        <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9B%94%EB%93%9C_%EC%99%80%EC%9D%B4%EB%93%9C_%EC%9B%B9" target="_blank">The World Wide Web(abbreviated WWW or the Web)</a> commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet.[1]

        Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
